# Eulerian

## Path

- A path that passes through all edges of the graph exactly once
- There must be 0 or 2 vertices with odd degress
- if there are 2 odd points, it must start at an odd point
## Cycle

- An Eulerian cycle is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and starts and ends at the same vertex
- conditions (for an undirected graph):
- All vertices must have even degree.
- in other words, there must be np vertices with an odd degree
